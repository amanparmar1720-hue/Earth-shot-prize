# Solar-Powered Outdoor Air Purifier (Earth Shot Prize Project)

A sustainable engineering solution designed to mitigate **urban air pollution** using a **solar-powered outdoor purifier** with multi-stage filtration and IoT-enabled monitoring.  
This project was developed as part of the **DES-602 Earth Shot Prize coursework** at IIT Kanpur.

## Project Overview
Urban air pollution from industries, vehicles, and urbanization poses severe health and climate challenges.  
Conventional purifiers rely on grid power, have high costs, and lack scalability.  
Our proposed solution: a **solar-powered, modular, and IoT-enabled purifier** that operates independently of the power grid.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Solar panel, HEPA filter, Activated Carbon, TiO₂ photocatalytic unit  
- **Electronics**: Arduino Uno, PM2.5 & VOC Sensors, IoT Module, Brushless Fans  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, AutoCAD (3D design & modeling), IoT dashboard for monitoring

## Project Workflow

### 1. Problem Identification
- Rising urban pollution causing health risks and environmental damage.  
- Existing purifiers are **energy-intensive, costly, and not scalable outdoors**.  

### 2. Proposed Design
- **Solar-powered purifier** for sustainable, grid-independent operation.  
- **Air Quality Sensors** (PM2.5, VOC, CO₂, NOx) for real-time detection.  
- **Multi-stage Filtration**:
  - HEPA filter for particulates  
  - Activated carbon for gas adsorption  
  - TiO₂-based photocatalysis for organic pollutants  
- **Arduino Microcontroller** for automation.  
- **IoT Module** for real-time monitoring and analytics.  

### 3. Working Principle
1. Solar panels generate power.  
2. Sensors detect pollutant levels and activate the system.  
3. Fans draw in polluted air → pass through multi-stage filters.  
4. Purified air released back into environment.  
5. IoT module sends real-time data for analysis.
